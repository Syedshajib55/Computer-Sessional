### **Email Etiquette**
1. **Structuring the Email**  
   - Follow a logical sequence: Subject > Salutation > Body > Closing > Signature.
   - Use CC for those needing to stay informed; BCC for privacy.  
   - Attach files with appropriate names (e.g., *"JohnDoe_Resume.pdf"*) and mention them in the email body.

2. **Proofreading and Spell Check**
   - Use built-in grammar and spelling tools (e.g., Grammarly, MS Word).  
   - Read aloud to catch errors.  
   - Check attachments and hyperlinks before sending.
